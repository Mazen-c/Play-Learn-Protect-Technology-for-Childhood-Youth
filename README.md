# Play-Learn-Protect-Technology-for-Childhood-Youth
Project Overview

Play, Learn & Protect is an interactive software platform designed for children aged 3–12, parents, and educators. It aims to:

Foster imagination, creativity, and social skills through playful and gamified experiences.

Deliver curriculum-based learning through interactive, engaging “serious games” in subjects like math, science, language, and coding.

Promote digital safety by monitoring online behavior, detecting risks like cyberbullying, and generating age-appropriate alerts.

This platform emphasizes culturally relevant content for local contexts and combines educational tools with creative and protective features, making learning both safe and fun.

Features
1. Gamified Dashboard

Real-time updates of points, badges, achievements, and leaderboards.

Engaging, child-friendly interface with simple navigation and visuals.

Parent and educator view for monitoring progress.

2. Curriculum-Based Learning Modules

Interactive modules in Math, Science, Language, and Coding.
