📖 Project Overview
Play, Learn & Protect is an interactive software platform designed for children aged 3–12, parents, and educators. It aims to:

Foster imagination, creativity, and social skills through playful and gamified experiences.

Deliver curriculum-based learning through interactive, engaging "serious games" in subjects like math, science, language, and coding.

Promote digital safety by monitoring online behavior, detecting risks like cyberbullying, and generating age-appropriate alerts.

This platform emphasizes culturally relevant content for local contexts and combines educational tools with creative and protective features, making learning both safe and fun.
